# Form

Brickdoc Design used [Formily](https://v2.formilyjs.org/) as react form solution.

To describe Formily in one sentence, it is an MVVM form solution that abstracts the form domain model.
Therefore, if you want to use Formily in depth, you must learn and understand what Formily's domain model
is like and what problems does it solve. After understanding the domain model, it is actually how to consume
the view layer of this domain model. This layer only needs to look at the documentation of the specific components.
