# Philosophy of Engineering

## Rails Doctrine

Many members of our core team are from the Ruby community and have been profoundly influential by [The Rails Doctrine](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine). We believe that these principles are the foundation of our engineering culture.

In particular, we believe that the following principles should be applied to our engineering practices:

- Optimize for programmer happiness
- Convention over Configuration
- Value integrated systems
