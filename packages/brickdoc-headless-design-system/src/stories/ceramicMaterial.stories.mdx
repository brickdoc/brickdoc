# Ceramic Material

The design language of ceramics has the following characteristics: depth of field, refraction,
three-dimensionality, and projection.

A three-dimensional space is shaped by depth of field, in ceramics are moved horizontally, vertically and
at different depths along the z-axis. Depth is depicted by placing elements at various points along the
z-axis in the positive direction towards the observer. The depth of field of the material is first simulated
by rotating the angles of the Y and Z axes. At the same time the depth of the z-axis appears as a refracted light.
