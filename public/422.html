先生遊南鎮，一友指巖中花樹問曰：“天下無心外之物，如此花樹在深山中自開自落，於我心亦何相關？”
先生曰：“你未看此花時，此花與汝心同歸於寂；你來看此花時，此花顏色一時明白起來，便知此花不在你的心外。”

The teacher was roaming in Nanzhen. A friend pointed to the flowering trees in the mountains and said:
(you say) there is nothing under heaven external to the mind. these flowering treesdeep in the mountains blossom
and drop their blossoms of themselves. what do they have to do with my mind?
The teacher said: Before you look at these flowers, they and your mind are in the state of silent vacancy.
As you come to look at them, their colours at once show up clearly. from this you can know that these flowers
are not external to your mind.
