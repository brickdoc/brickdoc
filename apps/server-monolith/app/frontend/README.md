# Server built-in frontend

> :warning: Refactor accounts and authentication is WIP.

For security and other reasons, some features such as authentication and sever-side rendering views are not provided by the [PWA client](../../../client-web/), but are provided by the server itself. This directory is the place to put those features.

We use a awesome library called [inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/) to build the modern React pages with classic server-side routing and controllers.
