# Design Token

Design tokens are all the values needed to construct and maintain a design system — spacing, color, typography, object styles, animation, etc. — represented as data. These can represent anything defined by design: a color as a RGB value, an opacity as a number, an animation ease as Bezier coordinates. They’re used in place of hard-coded values in order to ensure flexibility and unity across all product experiences.

Design tokens are directly integrated into our component libraries and UI kits. They cover the various options of platform scales, color themes, component states, and more.

## Colors

Brickdoc colors are designed to be clear and accessible.
They are used for text, backgrounds, borders, and more.

## Font

Typography is a core part of the design system. They are used for text, titles, and more.
