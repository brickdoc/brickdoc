MashCard is an all-in-one workspace and low-code platform with Compound Document at its core. It's not only an open source alternative to Coda and Notion but also an Internet OS of an age when SaaS is eating the world.

## Highlights

- **All your data is under your control** - MashCard is free and open-source software that can be hosted on your own server or from a cloud provider. As a [Solid](https://solidproject.org/) inspired decentralized data store, any access to the structured data and regular files stored can be granted or revoked as needed to any extent.
- **Meet Human-machine collaboration** - Create applications in the MashCard as if they were documents and apply AI to aid in actions like using excel-like formulas to import live data in apps or calling in external APIs. Enhancing synergy in modern productivity tools is a movement that will give rise to a platform shift where humans and machines complement each other.
- **Renaissance of the [mashup](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(web_application_hybrid)>)** - Integrate everything into one place, and ensure interoperability between them as easily as copy & paste.
- **Plugin architecture** - MashCard is an Internet OS with micro-kernel architecture that provides a WordPress-like plugin system to build, customize and express on top of it for an enhanced experience.
